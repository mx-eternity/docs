# Introduction

Matrix Eternity is a Project aimed to allow:

* Flow based command bots
* Easy Plugin development using [Wasmer](wasmer.io)
* Easy command creation using simple config based flows which use functions from various plugins

## Documentation Structure

This Documentation is split in 2 Parts:

<---> <!-- magic sparator, between columns -->
# [Developer Docs]({{< relref "/docs/developer" >}})
